# TwitterMap

The of this project is to provide you experience in developing and deploying a web application using AWS Cloud services. My web application would collect Twitts and do some processing and represent the Twitts on GoogleMaps.  

1. Use Twitter Streaming API to fetch tweets from the twitter hose in real-time.
2. Use AWS ElasticSearch to store the tweets on the backend
3. Create a web UI that allows users to search for a few keywords.
4. Use Google Maps API to render these filtered tweets in the map in whatever manner you want.
5. Deploy your application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk in an auto-scaling environment.
